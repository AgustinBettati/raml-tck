 Welcome to the _Zencoder API_ Documentation. The _Zencoder API_
 allows you to connect your application to our encoding service
 and encode videos without going through the web  interface. You
 may also benefit from one of our
 [integration libraries](https://app.zencoder.com/docs/faq/basics/libraries)
 for different languages.
